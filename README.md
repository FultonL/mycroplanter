This repository contains the processed data and code for the manuscript, "Distinguishing deterministic and stochastic processes in the rhizosphere microbiome" by Chen et al (anticipated publication 2024). 

Raw data (image files, plate maps, etc) can be found on Dryad (DOI: 10.5061/dryad.w9ghx3fxd). Only processed image data (pixel data) and cleaned metadata files are found here. The data are split into four analysis paths:


* Competition ratio experiment (compratio)
* Fluorescence experiment (fluor)
* Priority effects experiment (priorityeffets)
* Priority effects on plates (priorityplates)

In the main directory, you will find the image processing cript, 'process_athal_scan.py'. For help running the script, please see the associated README file.
